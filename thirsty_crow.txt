There was a crow.
He was very thirsty.
He flew here and there in the search of water.
At last, he reached a garden.
He saw a pitcher there.
The water was very low in it.
His beak could not reach the water.
He put some pebbles in the pitcher.
The water rose up.
Now his beak could reach the water.
The crow drank water and flew away.
