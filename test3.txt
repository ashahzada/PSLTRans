One day Phil and Leon went to the canal. 
They were going fishing. 
No-one was around that day.
 They chose the best place. 
They started to get out the rods. 
Then there was a loud splash.
Then there was a scream.
Phil and Leon looked up.
They saw something moving in the water. 
Then they saw a hand waving. 
Someone had fallen in the water.
The valedictorian looked young. 
She was dressed in a black graduation gown. 
Everyone stared at her. 
She knew they were looking at her. 
She looked out nervously.
She held the podium tightly. 
She read a speech to the public.
She wrote the speech herself.
Her audience was delighted. 
They congratulated her with applauses and cheers.
Something has happened
