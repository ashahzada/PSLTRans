There was a dog. 
He was very hungry. 
He got a piece of meat from a butcher's shop. 
He took that piece in his mouth and ran to the jungle. 
He was crossing the bridge of a stream. 
He looked into the water. 
He saw his reflection in it. 
He thought that a second dog was holding a piece of meat in the water.
He opened his mouth and barked at the dog.
His own piece of meat fell down into the water.
He lost his own piece of meat too.
